From the moment we decided to tackle emotional fraud and reveal the hidden manipulations in love, we knew we were stepping onto dangerous ground. It's a topic full of risk and controversy, one that hits uncomfortably close to real life. Unlike romance sims that are easier to fund or supported by well-known IPs, we knew from the start that our path would be a difficult one.</p></li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Sorry... we couldn't do better. We're a small team just starting out, and resources were tight. With so much content to manage and circumstances beyond our control, the game has its rough edges. Some sections might linger longer than expected, while others feel rushed. Voices were recorded after filming, so they may not always carry the immediacy of live performance. Camera work was sometimes limited by shooting conditions, and the technical polish may not reach the level of big-budget productions. We know the gaps are there, and we feel them too.</p></li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Sorry... there are things we couldn't fully express, and some truths we had to tread lightly around, and others we were forced to avoid altogether. Endings needed to lean toward the positive, staying within the rules and avoiding darker territory. Unseen boundaries imposed by media platforms forced compromises in a few places. We wanted to explore deeper, to be more forthright, but in some cases, we simply couldn't. As a result, parts of the experience may feel held back, or softer than you might expect.</p></li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >That's a lot of sorries. But they're not meant to seek sympathy or make excuses. We just want to be honest: within all these constraints, we poured everything we had into making this game with a clear conscience. Every member of the team dedicated their heart and soul to the project. Director Hu shared his life experiences and insights generously. One key staff member even ended up in emergency care from the stress of filming. Many parts of the game were completed at extremely low personal cost, with team members contributing despite having themselves been deceived. Our efforts weren't just professional duty, but a form of resistance against certain realities. We gave everything we could, awkwardly, stubbornly, and with all our strength, to follow the path we believed was right.</p></li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Did we ever regret taking this difficult path? The answer is no. Seeing our community's passionate messages and feeling the weight of your trust and support warms our hearts and makes all the fatigue vanish. In that moment, every hardship feels worth it. You make our effort feel worthwhile. Being able to come together and make our voices heard, to stand together against those who exploit love for deceit. That's what drives us.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >So please believe us when we say: no matter how much noise or how many challenges lie ahead, we'll stand tall.</p></li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >The noise doesn't scare us.

From the moment we decided to tackle emotional fraud and reveal the hidden manipulations in love, we knew we were stepping onto dangerous ground. It's a topic full of risk and controversy, one that hits uncomfortably close to real life. Unlike romance sims that are easier to fund or supported by well-known IPs, we knew from the start that our path would be a difficult one.</p></li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Sorry... we couldn't do better. We're a small team just starting out, and resources were tight. With so much content to manage and circumstances beyond our control, the game has its rough edges. Some sections might linger longer than expected, while others feel rushed. Voices were recorded after filming, so they may not always carry the immediacy of live performance. Camera work was sometimes limited by shooting conditions, and the technical polish may not reach the level of big-budget productions. We know the gaps are there, and we feel them too.</p></li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Sorry... there are things we couldn't fully express, and some truths we had to tread lightly around, and others we were forced to avoid altogether. Endings needed to lean toward the positive, staying within the rules and avoiding darker territory. Unseen boundaries imposed by media platforms forced compromises in a few places. We wanted to explore deeper, to be more forthright, but in some cases, we simply couldn't. As a result, parts of the experience may feel held back, or softer than you might expect.</p></li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >That's a lot of sorries. But they're not meant to seek sympathy or make excuses. We just want to be honest: within all these constraints, we poured everything we had into making this game with a clear conscience. Every member of the team dedicated their heart and soul to the project. Director Hu shared his life experiences and insights generously. One key staff member even ended up in emergency care from the stress of filming. Many parts of the game were completed at extremely low personal cost, with team members contributing despite having themselves been deceived. Our efforts weren't just professional duty, but a form of resistance against certain realities. We gave everything we could, awkwardly, stubbornly, and with all our strength, to follow the path we believed was right.</p></li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >Did we ever regret taking this difficult path? The answer is no. Seeing our community's passionate messages and feeling the weight of your trust and support warms our hearts and makes all the fatigue vanish. In that moment, every hardship feels worth it. You make our effort feel worthwhile. Being able to come together and make our voices heard, to stand together against those who exploit love for deceit. That's what drives us.</p></li><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >So please believe us when we say: no matter how much noise or how many challenges lie ahead, we'll stand tall.</p></li></ul><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><p class=\"bb_paragraph\" >The noise doesn't scare us.
