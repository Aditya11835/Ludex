If you're looking for something off the well-worn digital card game trail that has a great foundation and lots of room to grow, check it out!\u201d<br>Game Informer<br><br>\u201cEternal takes one big step toward Hearthstone from Magic: The Gathering. It looks and feels a lot like Hearthstone in practice, but brings back things like 'instant' cards that can be played during your opponent's turn, mana cards with specific colors for each faction, decks with any number of factions mixed, and declaring which of your minions will attack and then letting your opponent choose their own blockers. The key here is Eternal has managed to make all these things quicker and more satisfying than most other digital CCGs that try them, not sacrificing depth for accessibility.\u201d<br>PC Gamer<br>", "header_image": "https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/531640/header.jpg?t=1737566664", "capsule_image": "https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/531640/capsule_231x87_alt_assets_0.jpg?t=1737566664", "capsule_imagev5": "https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/531640/capsule_184x69_alt_assets_0.jpg?t=1737566664", "website": "https://www.EternalCardGame.com", "pc_requirements": {"minimum": "<strong>Minimum:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>OS *:</strong> Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8.1, Windows 10<br></li><li><strong>Processor:</strong> Intel Pentium D or AMD Athlon 64 X2<br></li><li><strong>Memory:</strong> 2 GB RAM<br></li><li><strong>Graphics:</strong> Graphics card with DX10 or OpenGL 3.x capabilities<br></li><li><strong>Network:</strong> Broadband Internet connection<br></li><li><strong>Storage:</strong> 3 GB available space</li></ul>", "recommended": "<strong>Recommended:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>OS *:</strong> Windows 7, Windows 8.1, Windows 10<br></li><li><strong>Processor:</strong> Intel Core 2 Duo E6600 or AMD Athlon 64 X2 5000+ or better<br></li><li><strong>Memory:</strong> 4 GB RAM<br></li><li><strong>Graphics:</strong> Graphics card with DX10 or OpenGL 3.x capabilities<br></li><li><strong>Network:</strong> Broadband Internet connection<br></li><li><strong>Storage:</strong> 3 GB available space</li></ul>"}, "mac_requirements": {"minimum": "<strong>Minimum:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>OS:</strong> OS X 10.9 (latest version)<br></li><li><strong>Processor:</strong> Intel Core 2 Duo<br></li><li><strong>Memory:</strong> 2 GB RAM<br></li><li><strong>Graphics:</strong> Graphics card with OpenGL 3.x capabilities<br></li><li><strong>Network:</strong> Broadband Internet connection<br></li><li><strong>Storage:</strong> 3 GB available space</li></ul>", "recommended": "<strong>Recommended:</strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>OS:</strong> OS X 10.9 or higher (latest version)<br></li><li><strong>Processor:</strong> Intel Core i3 or better<br></li><li><strong>Memory:</strong> 4 GB RAM<br></li><li><strong>Graphics:</strong> Graphics card with OpenGL 3.x capabilities<br></li><li><strong>Network:</strong> Broadband Internet connection<br></li><li><strong>Storage:</strong> 3 GB available space</li></ul>"}, "linux_requirements": [], "legal_notice": "\u00a9 2016 - 2022 Dire Wolf Digital, LLC.
