There are even whispers that Rupu have learned to tame even the most ferocious creatures and are riding them around the sands like giant war machines, but no witnesses are willing to confirm such a tale. The most terrifying of all, a massive sandworm dubbed &quot;The Long Ones&quot;, are the biggest threats nomads will face. The worms are ravenous. Once the beast focuses on a Walker, it loses sight of everything else. In order to defeat the worm, experienced nomadic hunters must band together. Entering its territory underprepared will mean certain death. If the hunters succeed, they\u2019ll have a reason to tap a few barrels of fermented cacti.

But recently reports have begun reaching the Flotilla that Rupu have been spotted wielding Flotillan weapons and repurposing weapons from broken down Walkers. There are even whispers that Rupu have learned to tame even the most ferocious creatures and are riding them around the sands like giant war machines, but no witnesses are willing to confirm such a tale. The most terrifying of all, a massive sandworm dubbed &quot;The Long Ones&quot;, are the biggest threats nomads will face. The worms are ravenous. Once the beast focuses on a Walker, it loses sight of everything else. In order to defeat the worm, experienced nomadic hunters must band together. Entering its territory underprepared will mean certain death. If the hunters succeed, they\u2019ll have a reason to tap a few barrels of fermented cacti. They\u2019ve just gotten their hands on some of the rarest and most sought-after resources \u2013 enough to make their entire crew rich and powerful.<br><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><img class=\"bb_img\" src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/903950/extras/544d4ee292193bd9c28e2292e59aba98.webp?t=1743622020\" width=492 height=48 /></span><br><span class=\"bb_img_ctn\"><video class=\"bb_img\" autoplay muted loop playsinline poster=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/903950/extras/34090a0c8200cc790b3d8c825e61817b.poster.avif?t=1743622020\" width=594 height=118 ><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/903950/extras/34090a0c8200cc790b3d8c825e61817b.webm?t=1743622020\" type=\"video/webm; codecs=vp9\"><source src=\"https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/903950/extras/34090a0c8200cc790b3d8c825e61817b.mp4?t=1743622020\" type=\"video/mp4\"></video></span><br>There are trade networks that stretch between the discovered oases.
