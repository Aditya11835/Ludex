# Ludex: A Game Recommendation System for Steam

Ludex is a hybrid game recommendation system for Steam, built as a 5th-semester B.Tech project at IIIT Pune. The goal is to go beyond popularity-only rankings and provide **personalized, content-aware recommendations** that help players actually discover and play the games in their library, instead of letting them gather dust.

> ⚠️ **Status:**  
> This repository currently implements the **Content-Based Filtering (CBF)** pipeline end-to-end (web crawling → refinement → detailed scrape → feature extraction → CBF recommender).  
> The **Collaborative Filtering (CF) + weighted hybrid** part is designed but **not yet implemented**.

## Motivation

- Steam has **hundreds of thousands of titles** and over **130M monthly active users**.
- A large fraction of purchased games remain **un-played or barely touched**, which is:
  - A **waste of money** for users  
  - A **lost opportunity** for developers  
  - A **risk** for Steam's long-term engagement

Steam recommendations today are driven heavily by **engagement loops** (“rich get richer”), burying high-quality but niche games.

Ludex solves this by combining:

- **What players play** (behavioural / CF – coming soon)  
- **What the games are like** (content / CBF – implemented)

---

## High-Level Architecture

### Planned Hybrid System

1. **Content-Based Filtering (CBF)**  
   - TF-IDF + metadata vectors built from:
     - Title  
     - Genres & tags  
     - Description  
     - Developer & Publisher  
   - Similarity measured with **cosine similarity**

2. **Collaborative Filtering (CF)** *(to be implemented)*  
   - User–item interaction matrix from Steam playtime  
   - User-based / item-based similarity  
   - Matrix factorization for latent preference modelling

3. **Weighted Hybrid (future)**  
Score(u, i) = α · CF(u, i) + (1 − α) · CBF(u, i)


---

## Current Implementation: CBF Pipeline

### 1. Steam Web Crawl (Basic Spider)

File: `steam_search_spider.py`

**Goal:** Generate a large list of Steam titles (~12k–20k) from multiple sources:

- Top Selling  
- Most Played  
- Category “Top Rated” pages  
- New & Trending  
- Global Search (infinite scroll)  

Output saved to: `data/raw/search_basic.csv`


---

### 2. Search Basic Refiner (NSFW + Non-English Filter)

File: `search_basic_refiner.py`

This step cleans the dataset generated by Step 1:

- Removes **NSFW titles** (70+ banned patterns)  
- Removes **non-Latin script titles**  
  (CJK, Cyrillic, Arabic, Thai, Hangul, etc.)

**Input:** `data/raw/search_basic.csv`

**Output:** `data/raw/search_basic_clean.csv`


This ensures the next scraper step receives only clean + English titles.

---

### 3. Detailed Game Scraper

File: `steam_details_spider_parallel.py`

Scrapes detailed metadata **in parallel** for every appid:

- Developers  
- Publishers  
- Genres  
- Tags  
- Full game description  

**Input:** `search_basic_clean.csv`  
**Output:** `game_details.csv`


---

### 4. Feature Extraction & Matrix Building

Module: `recommender/content_model.py`

Builds a high-dimensional game feature matrix using:

| Feature Block | Description | Weight |
|---------------|-------------|--------|
| Title TF–IDF | 1–2 grams | 0.3 |
| Tags + Genres TF–IDF | strongest signal | **1.0** |
| Description TF–IDF | semantic context | 0.15 |
| Developer OHE | studio identity | 0.2 |
| Publisher OHE | weak studio signal | 0.1 |

The final **L2-normalized sparse matrix** is saved to: `data/processed/recommender_matrix.npz`

---

### 5. Content-Based Recommender (Steam Profile)

Main modules:

- `recommender/user_profile.py`
- `recommender/clustering.py`
- `main.py`

The recommender supports **three modes**:

#### 1. Global CBF
Compare user vector to *all* games.

#### 2. Cluster-Aware CBF
- Builds SVD-reduced feature space  
- Clusters into 105 clusters  
- Scores user only within nearest relevant clusters  
- Faster + more relevant than global

#### 3. Multi-Anchor CBF (default)
- Uses user’s top-played games as **anchors**
- For each anchor → find similar games
- Merge, dedupe, rank by similarity

**CLI:** `python main.py`

## Planned Work: CF & Hybrid Model

Will implement:
- Hybrid weighting system (CF + CBF)  
- Ranking evaluation metrics:
  - RMSE / MAE  
  - Precision@K  
  - NDCG@K


---

## Notes on Design Choices

- TF–IDF on titles/tags captures genre + theme patterns  
- Descriptions add depth but are noisy → small weight  
- Dev/Publisher identity influences a game's “feel”  
- L2-normalization makes cosine similarity trivial  
- Cluster-aware scoring reduces noise and increases relevance  
- Multi-anchor mode handles multi-genre players effectively  

---

## Future Work

**Short-term:**
- Implement CF  
- Implement hybrid recommender  
- Clean modular configuration  

**Long-term:**
- FastAPI backend  
- Web interface
